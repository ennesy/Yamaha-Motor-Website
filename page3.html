        <h1>Toprak Razgatlıoğlu</h1>
        <p>Toprak Razgatlıoğlu (born 16 October 1996) is a Turkish world champion motorcycle racer contracted to race a factory BMW from 2024 in the Superbike World Championship, which he first rode at private tests held after the 2023 season at Portimão and Jerez.

            After riding for Kawasaki, Razgatlıoğlu rode a factory-team Yamaha YZF-R1 until 2023, winning the 2021 Superbike World Championship, ending Jonathan Rea's six-year reign. Razgatlıoğlu is the first Turkish Superbike World Champion.</p>

        <p>Born in Alanya, Razgatlıoğlu is the second son of famous Turkish stunt motorcyclist Arif Razgatlıoğlu who was known as Tek teker Arif which means Wheelie Arif. His father died, together with his girlfriend who was riding on the pillion seat, following a motorcycle accident in Antalya on 17 November 2017. As a practising Muslim, Razgatlıoğlu stands away during the traditional spraying of Prosecco on the podium following races, due to the prohibition of drinking alcohol in Islam society.</p>

        <h2>Superbike World Championship</h2>
        <img src="toprak1.webp" alt="Yamaha Logo">
        <p>Razgatlıoğlu was an upcoming performer with Turkish Puccetti Kawasaki racing team from 2018 and was partnered with factory Kawasaki riders Jonathan Rea and Leon Haslam for the 2019 Suzuka 8 Hours, a track endurance race. Due to not being allowed to ride with the other two taking turns throughout the race, Razgatlıoğlu soon left the Kawasaki marque to become a factory Yamaha rider from 2020. He became World Champion in 2021 after finishing 2nd in Race 1 at the Mandalika International Street Circuit.

            Under contract to Yamaha in the Superbike class from 2020 until 30 November 2023, Razgatlıoğlu was prevented by Yamaha from testing his 2024 BMW machine at an official test held immediately after the 2023 season-end race at Jerez in late October/early November, when Jonathan Rea, previously with Kawasaki Racing Team and Razgatlıoğlu's direct replacement, was allowed to participate on his new Yamaha.
            
            Razgatlıoğlu was offered a test on 22/23 November with gagging conditions attached, but chose to wait until 4 December when out of contract to Yamaha. He rode the BMW over two days at Portimão, followed by another test at Jerez.</p>

        <p>2022
            In June, Razgatlioglu got the chance to test the black Yamaha YZR-M1 during a one-day MotoGP private test at the Motorland Aragón circuit. Toprak switched from the Yamaha YZF-R1 to the YZR-M1 and did a total of 40 laps of the 5.078 km MotorLand Aragon circuit in scorching hot conditions. There is no empirical data in the form of lap times or photos of Toprak in action on the track as this was probably part of a super-secret test conducted privately by Yamaha. In the test, he was accompanied by Cal Crutchlow.
            
            2023
            Yamaha officially announced that Razgatlıoğlu would ride the Yamaha YZR-M1 during the development tests held at the Jerez circuit in Andalucía, Spain, when he joined Yamaha MotoGP test rider Cal Crutchlow for two days on April 10 and 11. This was the second test on the YZR-M1, following his first ride at Motorland Aragon in June 2022.</p>
